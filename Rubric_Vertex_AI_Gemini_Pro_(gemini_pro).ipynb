He got a good estate by merchandise,\\nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he\\nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very\\ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson\\nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we\\nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe;\\nand so my companions always called me.\\n\\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the\\nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk\\nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never\\nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\\n\\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my\\nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My\\nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of\\nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school\\ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied\\nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so\\nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and\\nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other\\nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity\\nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to\\nbefall me.\\n\\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent\\ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one\\nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and\\nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.

I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\n\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\n\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\n\\n0065m \\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\n\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\n\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\n\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\n\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\n\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house.

The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\\\n\\\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\\\n\\\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\\\n\\\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\\\n\\\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\\\n\\\\n0065m \\\\n\\\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\\\n\\\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house.

It correctly states that quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and uses qubits instead of bits, which allows for the representation of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This is a fundamental aspect of quantum computing and is accurately described.\\n\\nThe answer also correctly identifies the potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. It provides two relevant examples of areas where quantum computing could have a significant impact: drug discovery and materials science. These examples are well-chosen because they are areas of active research and interest in the field of quantum computing.\\n\\nHowever, the answer is incomplete as it ends abruptly after mentioning \\\"Quantum simulations can aid in\\\". It seems like there was more to be said about materials science and possibly other applications of quantum computing that were not included. This incomplete thought suggests a minor error in the response.\\n\\nDespite the abrupt ending, the information provided is accurate and informative, so it deserves a high score. However, the incomplete nature of the response prevents it from receiving a perfect score.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, I would rate the answer a 4 out of 5.

The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us.

Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him.

Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg!

Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing.

Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\n\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\n\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\n\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were.

And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him.

Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach!

Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate.

Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were.

And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him.

Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\\\n\\\\n0065m \\\\n\\\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\\\n\\\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house. \\\\n\\\\nWhat is the significance of the object in the narrator's breast pocket, and why does he consider it important to get it to safety?\\\"}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=4.0, value=None, comment='The provided answer correctly identifies the object in the narrator\\\\'s breast pocket as the map to Flint\\\\'s treasure, which is a central plot element in Robert Louis Stevenson\\\\'s novel \\\"Treasure Island.\\\" The explanation given for why the narrator considers it important to get the map to safety is also accurate.

Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\\\n\\\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy.

Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\\\n\\\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\\\n\\\\n0065m \\\\n\\\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\\\n\\\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house. \\\\n\\\\nHow does the presence of the revenue officers and their actions influence the outcome of the events at the inn?'}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=4.0, value=None, comment=\\\"The provided answer gives a relevant and accurate summary of the role of the revenue officers in the events at the Admiral Benbow Inn as described in the excerpt.

Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\\\n\\\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\\\n\\\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\\\n\\\\n0065m \\\\n\\\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\\\n\\\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house. \\\\n\\\\nWho is the blind beggar mentioned in the text, and what role does he play in the events at the Admiral Benbow inn?'}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=4.0, value=None, comment=\\\"The answer provided accurately summarizes the role of the blind beggar, Pew, in the events at the Admiral Benbow inn.

Many species of parrots are native to tropical rainforests, although parrots can be found in various other habitats as well.\\n5. **Kangaroo**: Grassland (Open areas with tall grasses) - This is mostly correct. Kangaroos are native to Australia and are commonly found in grassland habitats. However, they can also be found in a variety of other habitats, including forests and arid regions. The description could be slightly misleading by implying that kangaroos only live in grasslands with tall grasses, but it is not incorrect.\\n\\nGiven that all the classifications are correct, and the descriptions are accurate, the answer should be rated highly. The slight inaccuracy in the description of the kangaroo's habitat does not warrant a significant deduction since the primary classification is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, I would rate the answer as a 4. It is well-informed and mostly precise, but there is a minor point that could be clarified regarding the variety of habitats kangaroos inhabit.\\n\\nScore: 4\\n\\n4\"],\n [\"Sort these items into tech and non-tech categories: smartphone, apple, laptop, tree, AI, sandwich\",\n\"{'input': {'category': 'Categorization', 'question': 'Sort these items into tech and non-tech categories: smartphone, apple, laptop, tree, AI, sandwich'}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=5.0, value=None, comment='The answer provided correctly categorizes the items into \\\"tech\\\" and \\\"non-tech\\\" based on their nature and common usage.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Smartphone**: This is a piece of technology used for communication, internet browsing, and various other functions.
