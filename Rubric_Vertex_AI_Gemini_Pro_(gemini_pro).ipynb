Provide an extreme tldr sentance summary.\\\"}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=4.0, value=None, comment='The provided answer summarizes the introductory passage of Daniel Defoe\\\\'s novel \\\"Robinson Crusoe.\\\" The summary captures the essence of Crusoe\\\\'s background, his family\\\\'s status, his father\\\\'s advice, and his own decision to go to sea, which ultimately leads to his shipwreck and solitary life on an island. However, the summary does not mention the specific details about Crusoe\\\\'s family, such as his father being from Bremen or the change in the family name from Kreutznaer to Crusoe.

I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\n\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\n\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\n\\n0065m \\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\n\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\n\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\n\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\n\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\n\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house.

You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\\\n\\\\n0065m \\\\n\\\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\\\n\\\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house.

But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar.

And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him.

Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing.

Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\n\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\n\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were.

Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\\\n\\\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\\\n\\\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\\\n\\\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\\\n\\\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing. They\\u2019ve got off clean, and there\\u2019s an end. Only,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m glad I trod on Master Pew\\u2019s corns,\\u201d for by this time he had heard my story.\\\\n\\\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\\u2019s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\\u201d replied I. \\u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take it, if you like.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey\\u2014\\u201d I began.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cPerfectly right,\\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \\u201cperfectly right\\u2014a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\\u2019s dead, when all\\u2019s done; not that I regret it, but he\\u2019s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\\u2019s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I\\u2019ll take you along.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cDogger,\\u201d said Mr. Dance, \\u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\\u2019s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s house. \\\\n\\\\nDescribe the state of the Admiral Benbow inn after the buccaneers' search and the impact this has on the narrator and his mother.\\\"}, 'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='quality', score=4.0, value=None, comment=\\\"The provided answer accurately captures the essence of the state of the Admiral Benbow inn after the buccaneers' search.

I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\n\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\n\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\n\\n0065m \\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew.

I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\n\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\n\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\n\\n0065m \\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once.

I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me that I was right.\\n\\n\\u201cDown with the door!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir!\\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n\\u201cIn, in, in!\\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \\u201cBill\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n\\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\\u2019s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\\n\\n\\u201cPew,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been before us. Someone\\u2019s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it there?\\u201d roared Pew.\\n\\n\\u201cThe money\\u2019s there.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n\\u201cFlint\\u2019s fist, I mean,\\u201d he cried.\\n\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t see it here nohow,\\u201d returned the man.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\\u201d cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \\u201cBill\\u2019s been overhauled a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnothin\\u2019 left.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s these people of the inn\\u2014it\\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \\u201cThere were no time ago\\u2014they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \\u2019em.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\\u201d said the fellow from the window.\\n\\n\\u201cScatter and find \\u2019em! Rout the house out!\\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\\u2019s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s Dirk again,\\u201d said one. \\u201cTwice! We\\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBudge, you skulk!\\u201d cried Pew. \\u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first\\u2014you wouldn\\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\\u2019t be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\\u201d he cried, \\u201cif I had eyes!\\u201d\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\\u2019d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\\u2019s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it\\u2014a blind man! And I\\u2019m to lose my chance for you! I\\u2019m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHang it, Pew, we\\u2019ve got the doubloons!\\u201d grumbled one.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\\u201d said another. \\u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don\\u2019t stand here squalling.\\u201d\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\\u2019s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\\n\\n0065m \\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet\\u2014the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \\u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\\u201d and other names, \\u201cyou won\\u2019t leave old Pew, mates\\u2014not old Pew!\\u201d\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey\\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\\u2019s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \\u201clike a fish out of water,\\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B\\u2014\\u2014 to warn the cutter. \\u201cAnd that,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis just about as good as nothing.
